                    A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian 
                    origin, but mostly associated with France. Croissants are named 
                    for their historical crescent shape and, like other viennoiserie, 
                    are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough.

                    <li>1-1/2 cups butter, softened (Here are our go-to methods for quickly softening butter.)</li>
                    <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                    <h3>For the Dough:</h3>
                    <li>1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup warm water (110° to 115°)</li>
                    <li>1 cup warm 2% milk (110° to 115°)</li>

                        <h3>Step 1: Prep the Butter Layer</h3>
                        <li>Before we start the dough, we need to prepare the butter for the laminating process. In a small bowl, beat the butter and flour until combined. Spread the mixture into a 12×6-inch rectangle on a piece of waxed paper. Cover with another piece of waxed paper and refrigerate for at least one hour.</li>
                        <li>Pro tip: Use a clean ruler or measuring tape when rolling out the butter and dough. We want to be precise!</li>
                            
                        <h3>Step 2: Make the Dough</h3>
                        <li>While the butter chills, start your dough. In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water. Add the milk, sugar, egg, salt and two cups flour and beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes.</li>
                            
                        <li>Pro tip: Make sure the water and milk aren’t too hot. If they are, they could kill the yeast, which would prevent your dough from rising. The water and milk should be between 110° and 115°. If you’re serious about your pastries, we suggest investing in a good quality thermometer like this one from ThermoWorks.</li>
                            
                        <h3>Step 3: Roll It Out</h3>
                        <li>Roll your dough into a 14-inch square. Remove the top sheet of waxed paper from the butter layer and invert it onto half of the dough. Remove the other piece of waxed paper, fold the dough over the butter and seal the edges.</li>
                            
                        <h3>Step 4: Keep Rolling</h3>
                        <li>Time for some elbow grease. Roll the dough into a 20×12-inch rectangle, and then fold it into thirds. Repeat the rolling and folding twice. This is the lamination process and will give you all those delicious layers! If you find any air bubbles while rolling, pop them with your fingers or a toothpick. Once you’re done rolling and folding, wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate overnight.</li>
                            
                        <li>Pro tip: If at any point during the rolling and folding process your butter softens, stop and put the dough back into the refrigerator. You want to keep the butter cold!</li>
                        <h3>Step 5: Cut It Out</h3>
                        <li>The next day, unwrap your dough. Lightly flour your work surface, hands, dough and rolling pin to keep the dough from sticking. Roll your dough into a 25×20-inch rectangle. Using a pizza cutter or a knife, cut the dough into 5-inch squares. Cut each square diagonally in half, forming two triangles.</li>
                        
                        <h3>Step 6: Roll It Up</h3>
                        <li>Roll up the triangles from the wide end. Place them two inches apart with the point down on ungreased baking sheets. Curve the ends down to form a crescent shape. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.</li>
                        
                        <li>Pro tip: Be gentle as you work with the dough. You don’t want to squash the layers you worked so hard to create!</li>
                        
                        <h3>Step 7: Bake</h3>
                        <li>It’s finally time to pop them into the oven. Bake at 375° for 12-14 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire racks. Serve warm.</li>
